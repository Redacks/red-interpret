# Red-Interpreter

Just a little funny interpreter. Does not have that much features and the code is prob shit but who cares. It was fun coding.

Enjoy

## Red-Lang

Every line is a instruction. There are currently 4 Instructions

- Text -> Saves a string to a variable
- Zahl -> Saves a integer to a variable
- Output -> Prints out a variable
- Input -> Accepts user input (WIP)

## Example:

```
Text name = Anton
Zahl alter = 69
Text combined = Hallo $name$. Du bist $alter$ Jahre alt!
Output combined
```
